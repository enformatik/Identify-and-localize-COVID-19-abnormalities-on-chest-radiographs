# Identify-and-localize-COVID-19-abnormalities-on-chest-radiographs
**  In this project, we implement yolov5 object detection algorithm to identify and localize COVID-19 abnormalities on chest radiographs. 
**In particular, our model categorize the radiographs as negative for pneumonia or typical, indeterminate, or atypical for COVID-19.
